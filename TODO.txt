create git repo
add CI to build docker (upload on tag only)

add car extracts for all message types
add broadcvast of race flags to all connected cars (irregardless of key)
add race poistion updates for all connected
poll / update set of cars of interest every 60s

prevent overflow of any data : does it block on full or should we throw it asway?
need client to throw out messages older than certain time
 -> could that be done by an interceptor on the way out

move the race logic into the server so it can trgger and track along

do perf test to make sure it can handle traffic from race

add lemon-pi client grpc for this ... on pi it will listen for messges from car, and reconnect every 10, 30, 60 seconds on failure
add grpc posting for this
add URL config for this into lemon-pi and pit
if URL configured then keep wifi enabled
for lemon -pit even if no race-id running we still want to go into race mode through some logic

add rest endpoint too to server : allow admin login and starting of a race
 - do not allow the same race to run twice
 - do allow restart via rest
 - do allow more than one race to run at once
